ABOUT OUR WEBSITE:
We used google cloud maps platform to build the website.

We didn’t use longitude and latitude, because we used google cloud autofilling. That automatically places latitude and longitude for better user experience.
It prevents from fake addresses.
How to open website:
Click on Heroku link:

First go to signup and get into website.
Now go to home page click on add food items to add food items in menu where you can add them in your menu and fix price as well.

Go to home page again and click on add address button to add address of your hotel(hotel address should be genuine. Because google cloud will not accept fake addresses.)

Then click on ‘show me hotels near you’ to show hotels nearby you.(the map we got is from google cloud maps platform.)
 Type your location name. You will find hotels near you. 

Click on ‘order food’ option to see all the food items to order.
